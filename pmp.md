All of this worked like a charm, but we need to now move further. Currently, I see that the game is just basic, and we have worked on the foundation and basics really well. But we need to move further, and for that we need to make this game truly engaging. For example, the track lengths are just too short, the obstacles are too obvious, and stuff like that. So you need to be intelligent and then integrate all of this stuff, and then ensure that the game is really engaging. Don't focus on complex stuff, just focus on simple stuff that makes a game like this truly engaging. If you need any help from current web search and use of internet, then you can use the Firecrawl MCP server and use the deep research tool from Firecrawl MCP to find all the information that you need that is going to help you in doing this perfectly. So do this perfectly and correctly. All the best!
